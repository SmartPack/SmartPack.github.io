<h2 style="color: blue; text-align: center">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q1</strong>: Which version of kernel should I use?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: I recommend using the latest for stock and the latest Lineage-OS. If you are on a Lineage-OS based ROM  with an old built date, you probably need to find an old version of my kernel with a comparable build date (though you are advised to stay with the latest, if possible).<br>

<br><strong>Q2</strong>: Is your kernel's compatible with ROM(s) a/b/c?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: I do not know. All of my kernels are based off and tested only on Lineage-OS/Stock-ROM. However, if your ROM(s) a/b/c are based on Lineage-OS/Stock-ROM (and uses the same kernel source code), it will most probably work.<br>

<br><strong>Q3</strong>: Is this kernel better than stock/‘xyz’ kernel(s)?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: Regarding stock, Yes, It should be better in many aspects (Otherwise it will never been published). Regarding ‘xyz’ kernels, I don’t know. I even may not be used your mentioned ‘xyz’ kernels.<br>

<br><strong>Q4</strong>: How about performance/SOT?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: Since SOT, performance etc. are largely based on several factors such as ROM, installed apps etc. No one else can exactly predict the performance/SOT of your mobile. So, you should test and find out that by yourself.<br>

<br><strong>Q5</strong>: Can you tell me the best settings for performance/SOT?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: Again, that depends on several factors. I can only share my favorite settings that give me best results in my favorite ROM.<br>

<br><strong>Q6</strong>: Which are the best CPUfreq gov/CPU hotplug/IOScheduler/TCP congestion algorithm for battery life/performance etc?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: Again you need to find out those things yourself. To get more idea, I suggest you read this awesome <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/general/general/ref-to-date-guide-cpu-governors-o-t3048957/post59289777#post59289777">guide</a> by <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5811506">Saber</a><br>

<br><strong>Q7</strong>: Could you add feature x and y to your kernel?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: Not sure. It depends on the feature and the capability of the device. Anyway, I’m happy to check and add, if possible, any useful features (unless it is too experimental or dangerous) to my kernel. Please give your suggestions in the official xda thread.<br>

<br><strong>Q8</strong>: When will you release a new version of your work?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: New updates will arrive whenever I have something new to present in front of you (such as I managed to add new useful features or fix some existing issues or along with each LOS release with some changes in the kernel source code).<br>

<br><strong>Q9</strong>: I found a bug, what do I do?<br>
<br><strong>Ans</strong>: Please provide as much information as possible (such as what feature, what didn't work, screenshots or logcat if possible) and post in this thread.</p>
