<h2 style="color: red; text-align: center">Report an Issue</h2>

<h3 style="color: blue">General</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>In order to save the precious time of both "<b>me</b> and <b>you</b>, please be sure to read the following guidelines before reporting any bug about my applications.</tab1></p>

<h3 style="color: blue">What should include in a bug report</h3>

1. A clear description of the issue - the only way to understand the real issue is.
2. Steps to reproduce the issue - the only way to reproduce the issue on my device.
3. <b>Screenshots</b> or/and <b>Screen Records</b> (especially if you're reporting a layout issue) - to simplify the first two point.
4. If you're reporting an app crashing, please be sure to include a "<b>logcat</b>" captured at the time of the crash happened - the most important piece of evidence for me to know why the crash happened!<br>Please Note: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dp.logcatapp">Logcat Reader</a>, a simple and very efficient application available in Google Play shall be used to capture logcat.
5. Anything else you really think is important.
  
<h3 style="color: blue">What shouldn't include in a bug report</h3>

* Any logs other than the logcat unless the developer explicitly requested - almost everything except the logcat are useless except for certain situations!
* Any other unrelated information.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1><b>If your issue report doesn't meet the following criteria, please don't bother reporting to it. It will be most probably a waste of time for both of us and eventually ignored. Moreover, never ever report a bug like <i>"your app is not working on my X device running Y ROM and Z Kernel"</i>. It is mainly because</b></tab1></p>

* I may not have your device in my hand to reproduce the issue.
* I may not be interested in your favourite ROM/Kernel.
* I'm not a magician to solve the issues unless you give "<i>relevant</i>" information about the issue.
* I might have other priorities in life, so that it will be impossible for me to spend time for bug reports without "<i>relevant</i>" information.
