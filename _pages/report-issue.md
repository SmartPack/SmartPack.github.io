<h2 style="color: red; text-align: center">Report an Issue</h2>

<h3 style="color: blue">General</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Please be sure to read the following guidelines before reporting bugs about our applications.</tab1></p>

<h3 style="color: blue">What should include in a bug report</h3>

1. A clear description of the issue - the only way to understand the real issue.
2. Steps to reproduce the issue - the only way to reproduce the issue on our device.
3. <b>Screenshots</b> or/and <b>Screen Records</b> (especially if you're reporting a layout issue) - to simplify the first two-point.
4. If you're reporting an app crashing, please be sure to include a "<b>logcat</b>" captured at the time of the crash happened.<br><b>Please Note</b>: Logcat is an important evidence helping us to know why the crash happened. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dp.logcatapp" target="_blank">Logcat Reader</a>, a simple and very efficient application available in Google Play shall be used to capture logcats.
5. Anything else you really think is of importance.
  
<h3 style="color: blue">What shouldn't include in a bug report</h3>

* Any logs other than the logcat unless we explicitly requested. Almost everything except the logcat is useless except certain situations.
* Any other unrelated information.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1><b>If your report doesn't meet the above-mentioned standards, please don't bother reporting. It will be most probably a waste of time for both of us and eventually ignored. Moreover, never ever report a bug like <i style="color: red">"your app not working on my X device running Y ROM and Z Kernel"</i>. It is mainly because</b></tab1></p>

* We may not have your device in hand to reproduce the issue.
* We may not be interested in your favourite ROM/Kernel.
* We are not magicians to solve the issues unless you give "<i>relevant</i>" information about the issue.
* We might have other priorities in life, so that it will be impossible to spend time for bug reports without "<i>relevant</i>" information.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1><b>Thank you very much everyone for understanding.</b></tab1></p>
